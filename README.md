This GitHub repository contains a solution for a digital and interactive tourist map, developed as part of a 12-month project aimed at promoting domestic tourism. The Ministry of Tourism has identified the need to showcase points of interest within cities and regions, and a digital tourist map is an excellent tool for achieving this. The solution provided by the contractor enables tourists to access tourism-related information easily through the web or any mobile or other devices.



## Features

- Map Navigation: The solution allows tourists to navigate a digital map and locate places of interest and landmarks within a city or region.
- Access Information: Tourists can obtain details about the operating hours and accessibility of various points of interest.
- Transportation: The solution provides information about the transportation options available to reach different points of interest.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for points of interest based on categories (e.g., monuments, museums, squares) and themes (e.g., history, nature).
- Reviews and Ratings: Tourists have the ability to provide ratings and comments on the places they have visited, contributing to the overall tourist experience.
- Event Notifications: The solution keeps tourists informed about ongoing and upcoming events and exhibitions within the city, region, or a specific geographical area.

In addition to the above features, this project consists of two parts:

- Dashboard: The solution includes a secure dashboard where ministry personnel can log in and add new places of interest or events. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for managing and updating the digital maps. Ministry employees at both regional and central levels can access the dashboard to maintain and administer the maps effectively.

- Tourism Website: A dedicated tourism website is created to showcase the various places of interest, along with their corresponding events and exhibitions. This website serves as a comprehensive resource for tourists to explore and plan their visits. It provides detailed information about each location, including descriptions, photos, visitor reviews, and event schedules. The website's design is intuitive and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience.
